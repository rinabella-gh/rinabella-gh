# About me

Hello! You can call me Rinabella :) e-mail: contact@rinabel.la

As someone who tries to build in the public eye, this Github is used for showcasing my endeavors, public or otherwise. Many of these projects are quite ambitious and are just for fun; they may not ever get finished but that's okay! We take it day by day.

I track a lot of my incomplete development and writing via issues; feel free to make an issue on any of my projects, but I will probably close it out. If it is something I will pursue I will probably make a separate issue myself, just for the clarity.

## Why GitHub?

I generally advocate for GitLab, or even running your own code source control (pijul is really neat!). However my mental health keeps me very non-functional sometimes and GitHub is the most convenient option that is also the most public and it's what my brain has currently settled on for now. So, here we are.

### Catalog

Below follows a catalog of what you may find here.

#### Sociopolitical

##### Trans resources

I have had quite a few privileges in life and would like to share what help I can. There are plenty of trans resources on the net already, I find that often it helps to hear the same message in someone else's words. While they're not quite in place yet, you will be find some resources on voice training, my general thoughts on gender, how to get through these adversarial times.

##### Political commentary

A fair share of my writings will be quite political in nature; my goal is not to propagandize anyone but instead be very clear and honest about who and what I stand for. People hiding behind "both sides" or "this is not a political issue" are propagating one of this country's biggest lies: that being political and having political opinions is something to be embarrassed or afraid of. "Cancel culture" has been co-opted to frighten those who need not be afraid and shelter those who deserve retribution.

I do not condone nor advocate for violence of any form (including harassment).

##### Streaming/Recording setup

People should feel empowered to amplify their own voice, so I try to share anything particularly interesting or novel for my setups. 

#### Technology

##### Tutorials / Breakdowns

Technology can seem really opaque, and even I get overwhelmed sometimes! I don't profess to be an expert but I do try to give a less jargon-y take on technological happenings.

##### Fedora ublue/bootc images 

These are for specific hardware that I have with certain edge cases. They are not the most polished, but I do try to guarantee they work on the hardware they're deployed to! I'm usually using it myself in some form or capacity. Universal blue is an amazing project and most of my devices run some form of it (usually bazzite or fedora core).

##### Configuration files

For really specific configuration files that I don't want to go through the hassle of trying to find again. I may later expand these out to tutorials somewhere else.

##### Muse device / data readings

I have been fascinated with neuropsychology and so I will sometimes wear a headset to measure my brainwaves for fun. I have a repo containing a customized build I use for streaming. Honestly I don't really understand the data yet but I'm collecting for when future me does. 

I will also try to upload the data readings here.

##### Custom game engines/projects

A conceptual behemoth, I plan on writing an engine that can run in a plethora of different environments. This engine is called STAGE (STAGE Tells a Great Epic) and rather than focusing on immense graphical fidelity and complexity, I want it to focus on telling great stories and running various different turn based battle systems. I have always thought it would be fun to play a game where moves and the game itself could shift the battle from real-time to SRPG to turn-based. It's really ambitious, though, so it'll probably be a very long time till I get anything. 2030 would be fun :)
